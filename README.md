##Branching
This project follows the [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. We have two eternal branches `default` and `develop`. All features should be branched off of and merged back into `develop`. You should never push or merge new features to `default`.

##Naming
All asset/script/etc. files should be in [PascalCase](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2dbyw72(v=vs.71).aspx)
